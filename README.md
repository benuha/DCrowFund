# D(ecentralized) Crowd funding Project

This project uses Ethereum smart contract to create a crowdfunding website.

One important aspect of this project is:

The person/entity who raising the funds only can get the sum if a certain minimal threshold for the project is met.
Otherwise the funds are returned to contributors.

This's suitable for any kind of crowd funding in which there's no centralized entity to control and decide on the fund.

Website's created with Django Framework and Python 3.+
